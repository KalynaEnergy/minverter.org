# Project Goals: Developing Affordable Microinverters

The focus of this project is the design and development of a open source low-power DC to bipolar AC microinverter. <!--more-->The principal aim is to achieve a cost target of less than US$100/kW. The versatility of the microinverter allows it to support various applications including photovoltaic systems, battery charge and discharge, and other applications. The key intention is to lower the cost per watt of small-scale photovoltaic installations, thus making solar power more economically viable, particularly in less developed regions.
