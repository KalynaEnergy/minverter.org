You can do a lot of debugging with just an LED, but many things become easier if your program can print things for the developer to see. Y'know, hello world. The Arduino universe makes sure that this code is pretty easy to write, program, and see the output of:

```C
#include <Serial.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("qo' vIvan");
  delay(1000);
}
```

The IDE has a built in serial monitor, so this is all quite straightforward to do. There are a lot of things happening under the hood, but we neither know nor care.

In Zephyr, more of the complexity is exposed to the developer. The function call is printk(), but we need to ensure a console module is configured, connected to some type of transport, set up, etc. For Nordic's dev boards, this is taken care of by default. For an Arduino Nano 33 on nRF, we have to take a bit of care. The [zephyr/samples/subsys/usb/console](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/usb/console/README.html sample ([gh link](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/subsys/usb/console)) works out of the box, and uses the USB for console logging. [This lovely blog post](https://www.gnd.io/zephyr-console-output/) goes through some of the details, and the [Nordic DevAcademy course](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-3-printing-messages-to-console-and-logging/) covers setup and features.
