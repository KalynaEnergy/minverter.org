One of the joys of working with hardware is that you get to make decisions that have consequences. Here, for instance, in one of the many tiny decisions I made before I ordered my half bridge test board, I somehow ended up with a footprint that is incompatible with the part purchased from the bill of materials. It's not clear how that happened, but maybe I can figure it out later. More important is making another decision, as to what to do with this. Some poor assembly tech is sitting there shaking their head, then looking at me.
