As it turns out, the software will spit out a full render of the entire circuit, with traces and packages for all the components, assuming you have packages for the components you are using. <!--more-->Mostly I think this is just for fun, but it would be useful if you're needing to integrate the board into an external system, and you can get a sense of how dense the layout is and how difficult it would be to probe parts of the circuit.
