To interact with the world, the inverter will need to be able to measure voltages and currents at its inputs and outputs, as well as internal state. This is the realm of [analog-digital conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter). Because this need is so ubiquitous, many microcontrollers have some capability built-in. The nRF52840 has a [successive approximation ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive-approximation_ADC) peripheral, [documentation here](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fps_nrf52840%2Fsaadc.html). Its specs are reasonable: 8 single ended channels, 200 ksps overall sample rate, 12 bit resolution (14 with oversampling), 9 bits effective after noise and distortion. Much fancier units exist, but this is already there, on the chip. Maybe it'll be good enough.

Before going over how to use the ADC, let's talk about what our requirements on accuracy are. For a microinverter, the authors of IEEE 1547 were kind of enough to figure out minimal requirements. These are at least an excellent starting point. Here are some of the requirements taken from Table 3 in IEEE 1547-2018 Section 4.4:

| Parameter      | Minimum measurement accuracy | Measurement window | Range        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Voltage RMS    | ±1% V<sub>nom</sub>                  | 10 cycles          | 0.5 - 1.2 pu |
| Frequency      | 10 mHz                       | 60 cycles          | 50 - 66 Hz   |
| Active power   | ±5% rated power              | 10 cycles          | 0.2 - 1.0 pu |
| Reactive power | ±5% rated power              | 10 cycles          | 0.2 - 1.0 pu |
| Time           | 1% of measured duraction     | N/A                | 5 - 600 s    |
