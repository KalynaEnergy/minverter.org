So I'm coming back to this project after a somewhat extended hiatus. I've set up a site, which is good, so at least there's something for search engines to index, and eventually have content on. There's work to do to make the site not suck, and to get used to this format of content delivery. It'll take some time to get some of my existing notes up, and deliver updates on progress.

Eventually all of this very informal content will be removed, in favor of something that will look more respectable. But the audience right now is zero, so it doesn't matter. Practice with the publishing tools is more important.
