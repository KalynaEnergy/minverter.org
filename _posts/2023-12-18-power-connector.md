I revised the location of the output caps, and felt comfortable enough to get the board and parts list quoted. The vendor said could use resin in the power connection pads to insulate from the IMS board, but at an added cost. We're not trying to optimize for cost of prototypes, just the eventual product, but still. Also perhaps those pads wouldn't be the easiest to use anyway. An alternative might be to use a terminal block, like this [TE 282843-3](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-282843-3.html) Eurostyle screw terminal.

It'll be nice to get this thing ordered, so I can get back to working on what it and the firmware will actually need to do.
