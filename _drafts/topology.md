Inverters typically have a DC link layer, possibly fed by a boost converter from a lower voltage DC source, followed by an inverting power stage. There are a variety of circuit topology choices. One of the simplest is the full bridge:

The DC link can be connected to the load with either polarity. The switches are modulated to adjust output voltage level and waveform. This image is taken from Noman 2020, which reviews a range of transformerless inverter topologies.
