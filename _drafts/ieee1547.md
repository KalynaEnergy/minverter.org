| Requirement | Parameter Controlled | Requirement Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Voltage Regulation** (4.1.1) | Voltage | The inverter must regulate its voltage to within a specified range, typically Â±10% of the nominal system voltage. |
| **Frequency Regulation** (4.1.2) | Frequency | The inverter must regulate its frequency to within a specified range, typically 59.3 Hz to 60.5 Hz for a 60 Hz system. |
| **Power Factor Control** (4.1.3) | Power Factor | The inverter must maintain a power factor within a specified range, typically between 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging. |
| **Islanding Detection** (4.4) | System Isolation | The inverter must be able to detect and disconnect from the power system within two seconds of the detection of an islanding condition. |
| **Harmonic Distortion** (5.1) | Current Distortion | The inverter must limit its total harmonic current distortion to less than 5% at full rated output. |
| **DC Injection** (5.2) | DC Current | The inverter must not inject more than 0.5% of its rated output current as direct current into the AC power system. |
| **Flicker** (5.3) | Voltage Fluctuation | The inverter must not cause excessive voltage fluctuations in the power system, as defined by specific flicker curves. |
| **Interconnection** (6) | Connection | The inverter must comply with all relevant interconnection requirements, including protection systems, disconnecting means, etc. |
